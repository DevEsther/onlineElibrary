        Melissa had always been the responsible one, taking care of her siblings and trying to make her struggling family's life a little easier. But when she receives an unexpected inheritance from an elderly woman who was grateful for her kindness, Melissa decides to take a gamble on herself for once. She uses the money to book a luxurious vacation to a tropical island, hoping to finally let loose and enjoy herself.

But the flight to the island turns out to be anything but relaxing. Melissa finds herself seated next to the arrogant and infuriating Leo Flynn, a successful businessman who seems to take pleasure in pushing her buttons. She's determined to ignore him and enjoy her vacation, but when they're stranded on the island due to a storm, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to him.

As they spend more time together on the island, Melissa begins to see a different side of Leo, and starts to wonder if she might be falling for him. But she knows that any relationship between them is doomed to fail once they leave the island, and she's not willing to risk her heart on a temporary fling.

        As she was doing her hair, there was a knock on the door. It was Tyler, looking dashing in his suit. Abbey was surprised to see him so early, but Tyler explained that he wanted to make sure everything was in place for the wedding.
        
        Abbey was touched by Tyler's thoughtfulness, but she couldn't help feeling a little uncomfortable around him. She had spent most of the previous night trying to figure out her feelings for him, and she still wasn't sure what she wanted.

        As the night wore on, Abbey found herself spending more and more time with Tyler. They danced together and talked for hours, and Abbey realized that she was starting to have feelings for him.
        
        As the reception came to a close, Tyler walked Abbey back to her hotel room. They stood outside her door, and Tyler looked at her with a serious expression.
        
        "Abbey, there's something I need to tell you," he said. "I know that you're married now, but I can't help the way I feel about you. I've been in love with you for a long time, and I just had to tell you."
        
        Abbey was stunned. She had suspected that Tyler had feelings for her, but she never expected him to confess his love on her wedding night.
        
        "I don't know what to say," she said softly.
        
        Tyler took her hand. "Just think about it, Abbey. You don't have to make any decisions tonight. Just know that I love you, and I'll always be here for you."
        
        Abbey watched as Tyler walked away, feeling more confused than ever. She knew that she loved Ryan, but she couldn't deny the feelings she had for Tyler. She had a lot of thinking to do.

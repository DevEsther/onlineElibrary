<h3>The Beginning</h3>
<p>
    As she struggles to come to terms with her son's death, Tina begins to experience
     strange occurrences that she can't explain. She hears Danny's voice calling out to her, and she receives messages from him that seem to be coming from beyond the grave.

Tina becomes convinced that her son is still alive and that something mysterious is at play. She seeks out the help of a psychic named Elliot Stryker, who has helped her in the past. Elliot is skeptical at first but eventually comes to believe that Danny's
 messages are real and that he may still be alive.

<h3>The Search</h3>

    Upon arriving in Bishop, Tina and Elliot meet with some of Danny's former teachers and classmates. They learn that Danny was a talented student who was well-liked by his peers, and that he had a particular interest in science and astronomy.

As they continue their search, Tina and Elliot begin to uncover strange and unsettling information about Danny's disappearance. They learn that the circumstances surrounding his supposed death are shrouded in mystery, and that there are many unanswered questions about what really happened.

As they dig deeper, Tina and Elliot begin to realize that there may be more to Danny's disappearance than meets the eye. They start to suspect that there are powerful forces at play that are trying to keep them from uncovering the truth.

<h3>The Search Continues</h3>
<p>
    Mr. Keene tells them that Danny was on a camping trip with his classmates when he went missing. He explains that the students were supposed to be under the supervision of a teacher named Mr. John Henry, but that Mr. Henry had gone missing at the same time as Danny.

Tina and Elliot also visit the local police station to ask about the investigation into Danny's disappearance. They speak with a detective named Harry Standish, who tells them that the case is still open but that there are no leads.

As they continue their search, Tina and Elliot start to piece together some of the clues surrounding Danny's disappearance. They find out that Danny had been researching a book called "The Secret of Life," which he believed held the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.

They also learn that Danny's interest in astronomy had led him to make contact with a group of scientists who were studying a mysterious entity known as the Gorki Object, which was believed to be a new form of life in the universe.

<h1>chapter 4</h1>
<h3>The Man from the Inside</h3>
<p>
    Karl tells Tina and Elliot that he was involved in a project that focused on enhancing human intelligence and that Danny was one of the children who had been selected for the program. He explains that the children were given a drug called "Formula K-88" that had the ability to unlock their full potential, but that the drug had some unexpected side effects.

Karl tells Tina and Elliot that Danny's disappearance was not an accident, but rather a deliberate attempt by the T.C. Division to cover up the truth about the experiments. He warns them that they are in danger and that they should stop investigating before it's too late.

Tina and Elliot are skeptical of Karl's claims but decide to meet with him in person to learn more. They travel to a remote cabin in the woods where Karl is staying and find him severely injured. He tells them that he was attacked by agents of the T.C. Division who were trying to silence him.

Karl gives Tina and Elliot a key to a storage locker where he says they will find evidence to support his claims. He also gives them a message to deliver to his daughter before he dies.
</p>
<h1>chapter 5</h1>
<h3>The Secret Message</h3>
<p>
    When they arrive at the locker, they find that it has already been broken into and that the evidence has been stolen. However, they do find a hidden compartment containing a note from Karl's daughter, telling him to meet her at a certain location.

Tina and Elliot decide to follow the clue and head to the location, which turns out to be a rundown trailer park. There, they find Karl's daughter, Judy, who is afraid for her life and believes that the T.C. Division is after her. She gives them a package of documents that belonged to her father, including photographs and reports on the experiments conducted on Danny and the other children.

Tina and Elliot are shocked by what they see in the documents and realize that Karl's claims were true. The reports describe how the T.C. Division used children as test subjects for a drug that enhanced their intelligence, but also caused unpredictable side effects such as hallucinations, seizures, and violent outbursts.

As they leave the trailer park, Tina and Elliot are followed by a group of men who appear to be working for the T.C. Division. They narrowly escape and return to their motel room, where they begin to piece together the information they've gathered.

 <h3>The Lonely Road</h3>

    As they drive, they encounter a strange man standing by the side of the road, who seems to be in distress. Elliot stops to help him, but the man pulls out a gun and tries to rob them. Elliot fights back and manages to disarm the man, but he runs off into the desert.

Tina and Elliot continue on their journey, but they are increasingly aware of the danger they are in. They stop at a gas station to fill up their car and get some food, but they are followed by a suspicious-looking man who seems to be watching them.

When they get back on the road, the man continues to follow them, so they try to lose him by taking a different route. However, they soon realize that they are being tracked by a helicopter, which is hovering overhead.

Tina and Elliot become more and more paranoid as they drive, constantly looking over their shoulders and wondering who is after them. They decide to pull off the road and hide out in a deserted motel, where they can try to regroup and plan their next move.

    hile they are walking around the city, they are approached by a man who claims to have information about the T.C. Division. He tells them that the Division has a secret laboratory outside of Las Vegas where they conduct their experiments. The man also warns them that the Division is very dangerous and that they should be careful.

Tina and Elliot decide to investigate the laboratory, so they rent a car and head out into the desert. After driving for several hours, they come across a remote facility that matches the description they were given. They park their car and sneak inside.

Once inside, they discover that the laboratory is being used to conduct experiments on animals, including dogs and monkeys. They also find evidence that the laboratory is linked to the virus that killed Tina's son Danny.

As they are exploring the laboratory, they are confronted by a group of armed guards. They manage to escape and make their way back to Las Vegas, where they decide to try and expose the T.C. Division to the authorities.

As they travel deeper into the wilderness, they come across a group of Native Americans who are camped nearby. The Native Americans offer them shelter and a place to rest, and Tina and Elliot gratefully accept.

While they are staying with the Native Americans, they learn about their spiritual beliefs and the legend of the "Katchinas," powerful spirits that protect their people. Tina is particularly interested in these legends and begins to feel a connection to the spirits.

    Stryker is a controversial figure who has been accused of being a fraud by some and hailed as a miracle worker by others. Tina is skeptical of Stryker's abilities but is desperate to find any way to connect with her son.

During the meeting, Stryker places Tina in a trance and begins to speak to her as if he is Danny. Tina is initially hesitant, but as the conversation progresses, she becomes convinced that Stryker is truly communicating with her son.

Danny tells Tina that he is not really dead but has been taken by a secret government organization called the "Division of Biological Intelligence," or DBI for short. He claims that the DBI has been experimenting on him and other children with psychic abilities in an effort to create a new breed of super-soldier.

Tina is horrified by this revelation and resolves to do whatever it takes to rescue her son from the clutches of the DBI. She enlists the help of a journalist named Chad, who has connections within the government and promises to help her uncover the truth about the DBI's activities.

As Tina and Chad dig deeper, they begin to uncover a web of secrets and lies that threaten to destroy everything they hold dear. But they remain determined to rescue Danny and put an end to the DBI's sinister experiments once and for all.

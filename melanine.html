    <h1>chapter 1</h1>
    <p>
        The story opens with a young and beautiful model named Angelica. She is feeling low and exhausted, both physically and emotionally, after working on a photo shoot for the last 16 hours straight. She is desperate to go home and catch up on some sleep, but her agent, Jemma, informs her that the famous Italian billionaire, Marco Marcolini, has requested her for a private photo shoot.

        Despite her reluctance, Jemma convinces Angelica to take up the offer by informing her that it would be a great opportunity to make a name for herself in the industry. Angelica reluctantly agrees, and soon, she finds herself in the luxurious apartment of Marco Marcolini.
        
        Angelica is mesmerized by the grandeur of the place and the enigma of Marco. However, Marco is not impressed with Angelica's casual attire, and he orders her to change into something more glamorous for the shoot. As Angelica goes to the bathroom to change, she realizes that Marco's apartment is filled with diamonds, and she wonders what kind of man would live surrounded by such opulence.
        
        Angelica emerges from the bathroom in a stunning red dress, and Marco is impressed with her transformation. He then proceeds to direct the photo shoot, and Angelica is surprised to find that she is enjoying herself. She finds herself attracted to Marco's rugged good looks and charm.
        
        After the photo shoot, Marco asks Angelica to join him for dinner. Angelica agrees, and they head out to a fancy restaurant. During dinner, Marco reveals that he needs a wife to inherit his family business and continue his legacy. He proposes to Angelica, offering her a marriage of convenience, and in return, he promises to help her achieve her dreams of becoming a successful model.
        
        Angelica is stunned by the proposal and hesitant to accept it, but Marco manages to convince her with his charm and charisma. They agree to get married, and Angelica finds herself caught up in a whirlwind of luxury, romance, and passion. However, as she gets to know Marco better, she realizes that there is a darker side to him and his family business, and she begins to question her decision to marry him.

    <p>
        Rafael greeted his grandmother and the family solicitor, Mr. Anderson, in the study. He didn't know why they were there, but he had a feeling it was something to do with the trust his grandfather had left him. His grandfather's will had strict instructions that he wasn't to be told what was in the trust until he turned thirty-five. Rafael still had six years to go before he reached that age.

His grandmother, however, had always been very fond of him and had a tendency to meddle in his life. Rafael couldn't help wondering if this meeting had something to do with her.

"Rafael, my dear boy," his grandmother said, giving him a hug. "I'm so glad you could come."

Rafael pulled away, frowning. "Of course, Grandmother. But why all the secrecy? What's going on?"

"Mr. Anderson has some documents he needs you to sign," his grandmother said, gesturing to the solicitor.

"Documents?" Rafael repeated, feeling a sense of unease. "What kind of documents?"

"Nothing to worry about," Mr. Anderson said, handing him a stack of papers. "It's just some routine paperwork. Your grandmother is concerned about your financial future, and this will help ensure your security."

Rafael frowned, looking over the papers. They seemed harmless enough, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Still, he signed them, not wanting to upset his grandmother.

"Is there anything else?" he asked, handing the papers back to Mr. Anderson.

"Just one more thing," his grandmother said, taking a deep breath. "I've arranged a marriage for you, Rafael."

Rafael felt as though he had been punched in the gut. "A what?"

"A marriage," his grandmother repeated. "To a very lovely young woman. She comes from a good family, and I've made sure that the prenuptial agreement is in your favor."

"A prenuptial agreement?" Rafael repeated, feeling numb.

"Yes, of course," his grandmother said, patting his hand. "I wouldn't want you to be taken advantage of, my dear."

Rafael stared at her, feeling as though he was in a dream. "Who is she?" he asked finally.

"Her name is Isobel," his grandmother said. "Isobel Carmichael. She's the daughter of an old friend of mine."

"I don't understand," Rafael said, shaking his head. "Why would you do this? I don't want to get married. And even if I did, I would want to choose my own wife."

"I know, I know," his grandmother said, looking pained. "But I'm getting older, Rafael, and I worry about you. You need someone to take care of you, to love you. Isobel is a good girl. She'll make you a wonderful wife."

Rafael felt sick to his stomach. He couldn't believe this was happening. "I'm sorry, Grandmother," he said, standing up. "But I can't do this. I won't."

"Rafael, please," his grandmother said, standing up as well. "Don't be difficult. Think about your future."

"I am thinking about my future," Rafael said, his voice rising. "And I won't be forced into a marriage I don't want. I won't let you or anyone else dictate my life."

With that, he stormed out of the room, leaving his grandmother and the solicitor behind. He didn't know what he was going to do, but he knew one thing for sure. He wouldn't marry Isobel Carmichael or anyone else for that matter.

        After their dinner, Rafe and Maddie had retired to their room, where Rafe was standing by the window, looking out over the London skyline. Maddie couldn't help but be awed by the opulence of the room they were in, with its rich fabrics and elegant furniture.

"You know," Rafe began, not turning away from the view, "we could make this work. We could make our marriage a success."

Maddie was surprised at the suggestion. "You want to make this work?"

Rafe turned to face her then, and Maddie could see the determination in his eyes. "Yes, I do. I didn't marry you for the fun of it, Maddie. I may not have had a choice in the matter, but now that we're here, I want to make the most of it."

Maddie's heart fluttered at the thought of being with Rafe, but she couldn't help but be suspicious of his intentions. "What do you mean by 'make the most of it'?"

Rafe approached her then, standing just inches from her. "I mean that we should enjoy each other's company. We can go out, see the sights, go to parties. We can even share a bed, if that's what you want."

Maddie was surprised by Rafe's frankness, but she found herself drawn to him. "And what do you want?"

"I want you, Maddie," Rafe said, his voice low and husky. "I want to explore this attraction between us, see where it leads."

Maddie felt a shiver run through her at his words, and she couldn't help but be tempted by the idea of being with him. But she knew that there were complications to their situation, and she didn't want to make things more difficult.

"I don't know if that's a good idea, Rafe," she said hesitantly. "We're still married, after all. What if we grow to care for each other, only to have to part ways in a few months' time?"

Rafe reached out and took her hand, bringing it to his lips. "Then we'll make the most of the time we have, Maddie. We'll make it unforgettable."

Maddie felt her resolve crumbling under Rafe's intense gaze, and she knew that she wanted him as much as he wanted her. With a nod, she agreed to his proposal, and they shared a kiss that left them both breathless.

As they pulled away from each other, Maddie couldn't help but wonder what their future held. But for now, she was content to be in Rafe's arms, and she knew that whatever happened, she would always treasure the memories of their time together.

        Rafael could barely contain his irritation as he stepped into the luxurious penthouse suite of the hotel. The last thing he needed was to attend a fancy dinner with a stranger, but as CEO of his family's company, he was expected to make an appearance at events like this.

He glanced around the room, taking in the opulent d√©cor and the well-dressed guests mingling over champagne. His eyes soon landed on a woman sitting alone at a table, her head buried in a book.

He recognized her immediately as his new wife, Lily, and made his way over to her table. As he approached, she looked up from her book, her expression wary.

Rafael took a seat opposite her, not bothering to hide his annoyance. "What are you doing here?" he asked curtly.

Lily looked taken aback by his tone, but quickly regained her composure. "I was invited," she said calmly. "As your wife, I assumed I was expected to attend."

Rafael scowled. "This is a business dinner, not a social event. You have no place here."

Lily's eyes flashed with anger. "I'm here because I want to be," she said firmly. "And whether you like it or not, I am your wife now, and I expect to be treated with respect."

Rafael stared at her for a moment, taken aback by her boldness. He couldn't deny that there was something intriguing about her fiery spirit, even if it was directed at him.

He sighed, his anger dissipating. "Fine," he said gruffly. "But don't embarrass me."

Lily raised an eyebrow. "I have no intention of embarrassing you," she said coolly. "But if you continue to treat me like a burden, I can't promise to be the dutiful wife you want me to be."

Rafael was momentarily stunned by her words, and he couldn't help but feel a grudging respect for her. Maybe their marriage wouldn't be as unbearable as he had feared. But for now, he had a dinner to endure.

As the evening wore on, Rafael found himself glancing over at Lily more and more. She was dressed in a simple black dress that clung to her curves, and her dark hair was swept up in a loose bun that revealed the elegant line of her neck. Despite himself, he felt a stirring of desire.

When the dinner was finally over, Rafael stood up, relieved to be leaving. He turned to Lily. "Are you ready to go?" he asked, his voice softer than before.

Lily nodded, and Rafael led her out of the ballroom and into the elevator. As the doors closed, he found himself unable to resist any longer. He turned to her, his eyes darkening with desire.

"You looked beautiful tonight," he said huskily.

Lily's eyes widened in surprise, and Rafael couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at her reaction. He leaned in closer, his breath hot against her ear.

"And you have no idea how much I want to take you to bed."

    <h1>chapter 5</h1>

        The next morning, Darcy woke up early, feeling a little disoriented from the previous night's events. She had expected to be dismissed and sent away, but instead, Rafe had made it clear that he had no intention of letting her go. As she lay in bed, she could hear the sounds of him moving around in the other room. She wondered what he was up to.

When she finally got up and went to the bathroom, she was surprised to find that he had already left the suite. There was a note on the table in the living room that read, "Be ready by 8 am. I'll be back to pick you up."

Darcy wondered where they were going, but she didn't have long to wait. Rafe returned promptly at 8 am, looking as handsome and imposing as ever. He led her to his car and they drove for what felt like hours, eventually arriving at a large estate.

It was a beautiful place, with manicured lawns and gardens, and a grand mansion at the center of it all. Darcy was taken aback by its magnificence. Rafe led her inside, where they were greeted by a woman who introduced herself as his mother.

Darcy was surprised that he had brought her to meet his family, but she did her best to be polite and friendly. Mrs. Lombardi was gracious and welcoming, and she seemed genuinely interested in getting to know Darcy. She took them on a tour of the estate, showing them the gardens, the stables, and the various other features of the property.

As they walked, Darcy couldn't help but feel a sense of longing for the kind of life that Rafe and his family had. She had grown up in a small town in rural Australia, and had never known anything like the opulence and luxury that surrounded her now. She wondered what it would be like to be a part of this world, to have all the money and power that came with it.

But as they continued their tour, Darcy began to see another side of Rafe's family. They were cold and aloof, and seemed to look down on her. She could sense their disapproval of her, and it made her uncomfortable. She couldn't help but feel like an outsider, like she didn't belong there.

After the tour was over, they had lunch in the mansion's dining room. It was a formal affair, with multiple courses and an array of silverware and glasses. Darcy tried to keep up, but she was out of her depth. She had never been to a meal like this before, and she felt like she was making a fool of herself.

Rafe, on the other hand, seemed perfectly at home. He knew all the rules of etiquette, and he carried himself with an air of confidence that Darcy found intimidating. She wondered how she was ever going to fit into his world, if this was what it was like.

As they left the estate and headed back to the hotel, Darcy couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She had enjoyed the day, in a way, but she couldn't shake the feeling that she didn't belong there. She wondered what Rafe saw in her, and whether she would ever be able to measure up to his expectations.

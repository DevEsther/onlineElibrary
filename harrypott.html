    <h1>chapter 1</h1>
    <p>
        One night, Harry is working on his homework when he notices a large black dog staring at him through the window. Harry is terrified because he believes that the dog is a death omen. The next day, Harry learns from the Daily Prophet, a wizarding newspaper, that Sirius Black, a dangerous wizard, has escaped from the wizarding prison, Azkaban. The Ministry of Magic believes that Black is after Harry.

At the start of term, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express and is reunited with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. On the train, they meet a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin, who quickly becomes Harry's favorite teacher. However, when the train stops unexpectedly, the trio is confronted by Dementors, Azkaban's guards, who are searching for Sirius Black.

The Dementors cause Harry to relive his parents' murder, and he passes out. When he wakes up, Professor Lupin is giving him chocolate, which helps to alleviate the effects of the Dementors' presence. Later, Professor Lupin teaches Harry how to perform the Patronus Charm, a powerful spell that can ward off Dementors.

As the school year progresses, Harry becomes convinced that Sirius Black is after him, and he and his friends try to uncover the truth. They learn that Black was a close friend of Harry's parents and was falsely accused of betraying them to Voldemort. In the end, it is revealed that the real betrayer was Peter Pettigrew, who has been posing as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.

The book ends with a dramatic confrontation between Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Sirius Black, in which Pettigrew is revealed to be alive and Sirius is exonerated of all charges. The trio also discovers that Professor Lupin is a werewolf and has been helping Sirius, but they keep his secret and he is allowed to keep his job at Hogwarts. Harry leaves Hogwarts with a new understanding of his parents' past and a sense of hope for the future.

    <h1>chapter 2</h1>
    <p>
        As Harry wanders the streets, he spots a large black dog that seems to be following him. The dog is unnerving, but Harry dismisses it as coincidence and continues on his way. However, as he approaches a dark alleyway, the dog suddenly attacks him. Harry is able to defend himself using a spell he learned at Hogwarts, but he is left shaken and bewildered.

After the attack, Harry is approached by a group of wizards who were patrolling the area. They introduce themselves as members of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society of wizards and witches who work to protect the magical world from dark forces. The Order's leader, Albus Dumbledore, has tasked them with keeping an eye on Harry after he escaped from the Dursley's.

The wizards explain to Harry that he is in grave danger because the prisoner who escaped from Azkaban, notorious wizard Sirius Black, is believed to be after him. They reveal that Sirius is a convicted murderer and that he was once a close friend of Harry's parents. The group takes Harry to a safe house where he can hide until they can figure out how to keep him safe.

As Harry settles into the safe house, he can't shake the feeling that he's being watched. He also has vivid dreams about flying on a broomstick and seeing a mysterious figure in the distance. Despite his fear and confusion, Harry finds comfort in the company of his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, who are staying at the safe house with him.

<h1>chapter 3</h1>
<p>
    As Harry wanders the streets, he sees a giant, triple-decker, violently purple bus approaching him. It pulls up beside him, and a toothless conductor with a purple hat and cloak greets him, revealing that the bus is called the Knight Bus and is a magical mode of transportation for stranded wizards and witches. The bus is driven by a wild-looking man named Stan Shunpike who has a penchant for reckless driving.

On the bus, Harry meets an elderly witch named Irma Pince who gives him a reassuring smile and a free hot chocolate. He also encounters a mysterious, cloaked figure who is wrapped in bandages and seems to be in a great deal of pain. The figure is later revealed to be Sirius Black, the notorious prisoner who has escaped from Azkaban.

The bus takes Harry to the Leaky Cauldron in Diagon Alley, where he is greeted by the friendly innkeeper, Tom. Harry overhears a conversation between Tom and Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, who has arrived to investigate the escape of Sirius Black. Fudge informs Tom that Black is after Harry and that he must be kept safe at all costs.

As Harry is ushered away to a private room, he hears Fudge and Tom discussing the fact that Hogwarts will be the safest place for Harry to stay, and that he must be accompanied by a Dementor, a creature known for sucking the happiness out of people.

The chapter ends with Harry pondering the fact that he is not safe, even in the wizarding world, and that he is in grave danger from an unknown enemy.

<h1>chapter 4</h1>
<p>
    After overhearing the conversation between Minister Fudge and Tom, the innkeeper of the Leaky Cauldron, Harry realizes that he is in danger and decides to take matters into his own hands. He sets out to find out more about Sirius Black and why he might be after him.

Harry visits Flourish and Blotts, a bookstore in Diagon Alley, and finds a book about the history of Azkaban, the wizarding prison from which Black has escaped. He learns about the inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of Dementors as guards, which only confirms his fear of having to be in close proximity to one at Hogwarts.

Later, Harry runs into Hermione and Ron, who have also arrived in Diagon Alley. They have been working on their summer assignments and are excited to see Harry. They catch up and Harry tells them about his encounter with the Knight Bus and the ominous news about Black.

After some time in Diagon Alley, Harry, Ron, and Hermione head back to the Hogwarts Express to begin their journey to Hogwarts. On the train, they are joined by a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin, who Harry immediately takes a liking to. Lupin teaches Harry a powerful spell called "Expecto Patronum," which can repel Dementors.

As the train approaches Hogwarts, the students are told to put on their robes and prepare for the arrival at Hogsmeade Station. Harry, Ron, and Hermione excitedly make their way to the front of the train to catch a glimpse of Hogwarts Castle, eager to begin another year of magical adventures.

<h1>chapter 5</h1>
<p>
    As Harry, Ron, and Hermione make their way to the Hogwarts Castle, they see the black dog again, and Harry becomes convinced that it is following him. They arrive at Hogwarts and are sorted into their respective houses. Harry is pleased to be back in Gryffindor with his friends.

The next day, Harry attends his first Defense Against the Dark Arts class with Professor Lupin. He is impressed with Lupin's teaching methods and feels that he is finally learning useful spells to defend himself against dark magic. However, during the lesson, Harry is asked to perform the "Expecto Patronum" spell to ward off a Boggart, a shape-shifting creature that takes the form of the person's worst fear. Harry's worst fear is a Dementor, and when he tries to cast the spell, he is overwhelmed by the presence of one.

After the class, Harry confides in Lupin about his experience with the Dementor. Lupin explains that Dementors are creatures that feed on human happiness and that their presence can cause depression, despair, and even death. He also reveals that they have been stationed around Hogwarts to guard against Sirius Black, who is believed to be after Harry.

Over the next few weeks, Harry is haunted by the presence of the Dementors. He becomes increasingly afraid and withdrawn, and his academic performance suffers. He also experiences vivid flashbacks of his parents' murder, which he believes are triggered by the Dementors' presence.

One night, while returning from a visit to Hagrid's hut, Harry is attacked by a group of Dementors. He tries to cast the "Expecto Patronum" spell, but it fails, and he faints. He is rescued by a mysterious figure who casts a powerful Patronus, driving the Dementors away.

<h1>chapter 6</h1>
<p>
    As Harry continues to take his classes, he also starts experiencing strange occurrences around Hogwarts. He notices that his beloved broomstick is acting strangely during a Quidditch match, causing him to fall off it, and his Defense Against the Dark Arts textbook is mysteriously missing pages.

In addition to these strange events, Harry is also struggling with Divination class, taught by Professor Trelawney. Trelawney predicts Harry's death and causes him a great deal of anxiety. Meanwhile, Hagrid has become obsessed with his new pet, a monstrous bird named Buckbeak.

One day, while on a field trip with Hagrid, Harry and his classmates encounter a pack of Hippogriffs, magical creatures with the head of a giant eagle and the body of a horse. Harry takes a liking to one of them, Buckbeak, and is allowed to ride it. However, Malfoy insults Buckbeak, causing the Hippogriff to attack him.

As a result of the incident, Buckbeak is sentenced to be executed, much to Hagrid's distress. Harry and Hermione try to convince Hagrid to appeal the sentence, but he is too upset to listen.

In the meantime, Harry is visited by Lupin, who reveals that he knows about Harry's broomstick and textbook and suspects foul play. Lupin tells Harry that Sirius Black was James Potter's best friend and was framed for betraying the Potters to Voldemort, leading to their deaths. He also reveals that the reason the Dementors are so interested in Harry is that he produces a strong emotional response, which they feed on.

<h1>chapter 7</h1>
<p>
    As they make their way to Hagrid's hut, Harry and Hermione encounter their past selves and must be careful not to interact with them. They reach Hagrid's hut and release Buckbeak from his chain. They then hide in the woods and wait for events to unfold.

Back in the present, Harry and his classmates prepare for their final exams. During Defense Against the Dark Arts class, they practice using the "Riddikulus" spell to turn a Boggart into something amusing. Harry is surprised to find that the Boggart takes the form of a Dementor and tries to cast the "Expecto Patronum" spell but fails.

As the school year comes to a close, Harry and his friends attend the end-of-year banquet, where they learn that Gryffindor has won the House Cup. They also receive their final exam results and are pleased with their performance.

After the banquet, Harry goes to the common room and finds Ron and Hermione waiting for him. They tell him that Buckbeak has escaped and that they must return the time-turner to Professor McGonagall. However, as they are about to return the time-turner, they are confronted by Snape, who accuses them of stealing it.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione quickly come up with a plan to distract Snape and return the time-turner to McGonagall's office. However, as they are making their escape, they encounter a Boggart in the form of a Dementor. Harry tries to cast the "Expecto Patronum" spell but fails once again.

As they continue to flee, they run into Lupin, who casts a powerful Patronus and drives the Boggart away. Lupin then reveals that he is a werewolf and that Sirius Black is not a murderer but was actually trying to protect Harry from the real traitor, Peter Pettigrew.

<h1>chapter 8</h1>
<p>
    After the revelation that Pettigrew is still alive and disguised as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers, Harry and his friends begin to keep a close eye on him. However, Scabbers goes missing, and the trio begins to search the school for him.

As they search for Scabbers, they discover that the Fat Lady, the portrait that guards the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, has been attacked and is now hiding in another portrait. Dumbledore assigns a new guardian to Gryffindor Tower, Sir Cadogan, a bumbling knight who cannot remember passwords.

Meanwhile, Harry, Ron, and Hermione receive a letter from Hagrid, who is distraught over Buckbeak's impending execution. They decide to visit him and offer their support. During their visit, they learn that Dumbledore has sent Buckbeak into hiding to protect him.

As the school year comes to a close, the students attend the end-of-term feast. Dumbledore announces that Professor Lupin is resigning and that Snape will be taking over as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry and his friends are disappointed by the news and wonder why Lupin is leaving.

After the feast, Harry and his friends return to Gryffindor Tower but cannot remember the new password. Sir Cadogan, who has been drinking, offers to let them in if they can solve a riddle. However, they are interrupted by Snape, who accuses Harry of stealing from his office.

Harry and his friends are taken to Dumbledore's office, where they explain that they were searching for evidence that Scabbers is actually Pettigrew. Dumbledore believes them and tells Snape to let them go.

As they leave Dumbledore's office, Harry, Ron, and Hermione run into Lupin, who reveals that he is leaving because he is a werewolf and cannot risk hurting anyone at Hogwarts. He also gives Harry a piece of advice about the dangers of fame.

<h1>chapter 9</h1>
<p>
    Harry and Hermione follow the trail of the attacker, which leads them to the Shrieking Shack, a rumored haunted house on the outskirts of Hogsmeade. They enter the house and find Ron and a mysterious man, who they soon realize is Sirius Black.

Harry is shocked to see Black, who he believed was his parents' murderer, and wants to turn him over to the authorities. However, Hermione believes that they should hear Black out before making any decisions.

Black reveals that he is innocent and was actually trying to protect Harry from the real traitor, Peter Pettigrew, who has been disguised as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. He explains that Pettigrew was the one who betrayed Harry's parents and that he is now in the house with them.

Just then, they hear a noise and realize that Pettigrew is nearby. They begin to search the house and eventually find him hiding in a corner. However, Pettigrew manages to escape and transform into a rat once again, fleeing into the night.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione are left feeling defeated and wondering what to do next. They decide to return to Hogwarts and tell Dumbledore everything that has happened. However, they are intercepted by Lupin, who has transformed into a werewolf and is now loose on the grounds.

Harry and Hermione run for their lives and eventually find themselves trapped on the shore of the lake.

<h1>chapter 10</h1>
<p>
    After the events of the previous chapter, Harry is still processing the fact that he had gone back in time to save himself and Hermione. However, they have to put their shock aside as they continue to pursue the truth about what happened to Harry's parents.

Harry receives a mysterious gift in the form of a map of Hogwarts, known as the Marauder's Map. The map shows the location of every person in Hogwarts and the secret passages that lead in and out of the school. The map also has a message on it: "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."

The map is created by Harry's father, James Potter, and his friends, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew, who are known as the Marauders. Harry and his friends use the map to track down Pettigrew, who they believe is still at Hogwarts.

They follow Pettigrew to the Shrieking Shack and confront him, but he manages to escape once again. As they are leaving the Shrieking Shack, they run into Lupin, who reveals that he is a werewolf and that he has been taking a potion to control his transformations.

Lupin also tells Harry about his father and his friends, and how they created the Marauder's Map. He gives Harry a special tool that will help him to use the map to its fullest potential.

Harry and his friends continue to use the map to track Pettigrew, who they discover is hiding in Ron's bedchamber. They alert the authorities, and Pettigrew is finally captured.

As the school year comes to an end, Dumbledore meets with Harry to discuss what has happened. He reveals that Pettigrew was responsible for betraying Harry's parents and that he is now in Azkaban prison.

Dumbledore also tells Harry that he believes that Black is innocent and that he was actually trying to protect Harry from Pettigrew. He also warns Harry that there are those who will try to use him for their own gain and that he must be careful.

The chapter ends with Harry, Ron, and Hermione saying goodbye to Hagrid and returning home for the summer. Harry is left feeling grateful for his friends and the fact that he has finally found some closure about his parents' death.

        Carly couldn't believe her bad luck. After leaving her job and fiancé in London, she had traveled halfway across the world to Australia, hoping to start a new life. Instead, she found herself stranded in the outback with a flat tire and no spare.

        Just as she was starting to panic, a dark-haired stranger on a motorcycle pulled up beside her. He introduced himself as Luke, and after assessing the situation, he offered to give her a lift to the nearest town where she could get her tire fixed.
        
        As Carly held on tight to Luke's strong back, she couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement. He was like no man she had ever met before – ruggedly handsome, confident, and dangerous. She knew she should keep her distance, but the attraction was too strong.
        
        When they arrived in town, Luke took Carly to a local café where he worked as a cook. As they sat at the counter eating burgers and drinking coffee, Carly couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth and belonging that she hadn't felt in a long time.
        
        But as they talked, Carly sensed that there was something Luke was hiding from her. When she asked him about his past, he became guarded and changed the subject.
        
        Despite her reservations, Carly found herself drawn to Luke, and she couldn't help but wonder what secrets he was keeping.

        Leah woke up feeling both elated and apprehensive. Elated because last night had been wonderful, and apprehensive because she didn't know what to do next. She had slept with her boss, and she wasn't sure how to handle it.

When she got to work, she tried to act as if nothing had happened. She greeted Gideon with a smile and a cheerful "good morning," but he seemed to be avoiding her. He didn't look at her when she spoke to him, and he was curt when he gave her instructions.

Leah tried not to let it bother her, but she couldn't help feeling hurt. Had last night meant nothing to him? Was it just a one-night stand for him?

She was so caught up in her thoughts that she almost didn't hear Gideon when he spoke to her.

"Leah, can I see you in my office for a moment?" he asked.

Leah's heart sank. This was it. He was going to tell her that last night was a mistake, that he regretted it, and that it couldn't happen again.

She followed him to his office and sat down in one of the chairs in front of his desk. He closed the door behind them and sat down in his chair.

"Leah, about last night," he began.

Here it comes, Leah thought.

"I just wanted to make sure that you're okay with what happened."

Leah was surprised. "What do you mean?" she asked.

"I mean, I don't want you to feel like you were pressured into anything. I want to make sure that you're comfortable with what happened between us."

Leah smiled. "I'm more than comfortable," she said.

Gideon smiled back at her. "Good. I just wanted to make sure. And Leah, I want you to know that last night meant a lot to me. I don't want it to be a one-time thing. I want to see where this could go."

Leah's heart skipped a beat. "Me too," she said.

Gideon got up from his chair and walked around the desk to stand in front of her. He took her hand in his and leaned down to kiss her.

Leah felt a surge of happiness. She had no idea where this was going, but for now, she was content just to see where it would take her.

One night, Rafe asked Bryn to have dinner with him at a local restaurant. She agreed, and they had a wonderful time. Rafe found himself laughing and joking with her, feeling more relaxed and carefree than he had in years.

Rafe pulled away, his heart racing. He knew he shouldn't be doing this, but he couldn't help himself. Bryn looked up at him with her big, brown eyes, and he knew he was in trouble.

"I can't do this, Bryn," he said, taking a step back.

"Why not?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Because I'm your boss, and I don't want to take advantage of you."

"You're not taking advantage of me," she said, moving closer to him. "I want this, Rafe. I want you."

Rafe hesitated for a moment, but then he gave in. He pulled Bryn to him, and they kissed again, harder this time. Rafe's hands roamed over her body, and he felt a surge of desire that he had never felt before.

They stumbled into the house, tearing at each other's clothes. They made love on the sofa, and it was unlike anything Rafe had ever experienced. He knew it was wrong, but he couldn't bring himself to stop.

Afterward, they lay there, their bodies entwined. Rafe knew he was in trouble. He had fallen for Bryn, and he didn't know what to do about it.
